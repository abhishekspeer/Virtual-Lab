## About

Virtual Lab introduces a new dimension to the chemistry lab courses offered at Birla Institute of Technology & Science, Pilani. Developed as an aid to help students during online teaching, students save time through reduction in time required for setup and restart procedures as instant repetition of an experiment is available at the click of a button. 

The other interactive features such as animations, walkthroughs, and virtual simulations provide students with the platform to explore chemical concepts in more detail.

Virtual Lab is a desktop based application developed using [PyQt](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/).
